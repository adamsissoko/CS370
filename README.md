<h3>My Projects</h3>

<h4>Cartpole</h4>
<p>
  The cartpole problem is a classic reinforcement learning task that involves developing a neural network to balance a "pole" on a "cart". Below is a screenshot demonstrating my successful solution.

<h4>Pirate Treasure Hunt</h4>
<p>
  This project uses a Deep Q-Learning algorithm with two neural networks to find a path to "treasure" in a maze. Starting from the upper left corner, the "pirate" agent needs to reach the treasure in the lower right. Below is the matrix defining the maze.

<p>
  The pirate agent solves the maze efficiently, using Keras for the Deep Q-Learning algorithm. Below are the starting and ending grids.

    <td><img src="https://github.com/adamsissoko/images/finish.png" alt="[Finish]" style="width:200px;height:200px;"></td>

<h3>My Learning as a Computer Scientist</h3>
<p>
  My approach to problem-solving is methodical and logical. I can see both the minute details and the overarching 'big picture,' ensuring that every part contributes effectively to the whole.
</p>
<p>
  Ethically, it's crucial to maintain a sense of responsibility when developing advanced algorithms. The projects showcased here are a testament to an ethical and methodical approach to computer science challenges.
