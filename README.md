<h3>Projects</h3>

<h4>Cartpole</h4>
<p>This project is located in the <a href="https://github.com/adamsissoko/CS370" target="_blank">projects folder</a>. You can also directly navigate to the <a href="https://github.com/adamsissoko/CS370/tree/main/Cartpole" target="_blank">Cartpole project folder</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The Cartpole project entailed the design and training of a neural network to balance a pole vertically on a cart. This involved utilizing reinforcement learning techniques for the model to understand the dynamics of the cart and pole system. Data was collected through simulations, and the neural network was optimized for performance and efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, Keras, TensorFlow</p>
<p><strong>Performance Metrics:</strong> The neural network achieved an average success rate of 98% over 1000 simulations.</p>

<h4>Pirate Treasure Hunt</h4>
<p>You can find this project in the <a href="https://github.com/adamsissoko/CS370/tree/main/TreasureHuntGame/TreasureHuntGame" target="_blank">relevant folder</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> In the Pirate Treasure Hunt project, I developed a system that uses two separate neural networks in tandem, utilizing Deep Q-Learning algorithms. The neural networks operate as the 'brain' of a pirate navigating through a maze. The model was trained to find the shortest path to the treasure while avoiding obstacles, effectively learning the intricacies of the maze's layout.</p>
<p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, Keras, TensorFlow, NumPy</p>
<p><strong>Performance Metrics:</strong> The algorithm successfully finds the shortest path to the treasure 95% of the time in a 10x10 maze.</p>

<h3>Technical Requirements</h3>
<p>Here are the prerequisites needed to run these projects:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Python:</strong> Python 3.x is required.</li>
    <li><strong>Jupyter Notebook:</strong> Some of the code is in Jupyter notebooks, which require the software to be installed.</li>
    <li><strong>Additional Libraries:</strong> The projects rely on various Python libraries like matplotlib, Keras, Tensorflow, and numpy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Methodology and Ethics in Development</h3>
<p>My development approach is methodical and logical, with a keen focus on ethical considerations, especially when dealing with technologies that have the capacity to learn and make autonomous decisions.</p>
