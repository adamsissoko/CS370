<h1>Adam Sissoko's Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning Projects</h1>
<h2>Recent Graduate, B.S. in Computer Science</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>As a Computer Science graduate, I have explored advanced topics in the field, with a focus on Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning. Below are some of the projects that I have worked on to understand and apply advanced algorithms, neural networks, and Q-Learning techniques.</p>

<h3>My Projects</h3>

<h4>Cartpole</h4>
<p>You can find this project in my <a href="https://github.com/adamsissoko/ML_RL_Projects" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>. The project involves developing a neural network that learns to balance a "pole" on a "cart" through reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>For more insights into the cartpole problem, read <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-cartepole-problem-competitive-performance-with-particle-swarm-optimization-672f018ede3c" target="_blank">this article</a>.</p>

<h4>Pirate Treasure Hunt</h4>
<p>This project was a fun exercise in developing a Deep Q-Learning algorithm. The "pirate" agent starts at the upper-left corner of the maze, and the "treasure" is located in the lower-right corner. The agent uses neural networks to make informed decisions to find the path to the treasure.</p>

<p>My solution for this project is based on extensive research and is crafted with Python and Keras. The agent solves the maze in about 13 minutes.</p>

<p>What's interesting is the variance in solutions due to the exploitation/exploration ratio employed in the DQN algorithm.</p>

          <th>Solution 1</th>
          <th>Solution 2</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><img src="path/to/alt_finish.png" alt="[alternative finish]" style="width:200px;height:200px;"></td>
          <td><img src="path/to/finish.png" alt="[finish]" style="width:200px;height:200px;"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
</div>

<h3>Learning and Ethics</h3>
<p>
My approach to problem-solving is methodical and logical. I consider both the limitations and capabilities of the tools at my disposal. My focus remains on both the fine details and the big picture. Ethically speaking, the potential impacts of algorithms, especially those capable of "learning," should be handled with care and consideration for broader societal impacts.
