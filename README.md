<h3>My Projects</h3>

<h4>Cartpole</h4>
<p>All my projects are accessible in the <a href="https://github.com/adamsissoko/CS370" target="_blank">projects folder</a>. Two of my favorites include the <a href="https://github.com/adamsissoko/CS370/tree/main/Cartpole" target="_blank">cartpole problem project</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/adamsissoko/CS370/tree/main/TreasureHuntGame/TreasureHuntGame" target="_blank">pirate treasure hunt project</a>.</p>

<p>Learn more about the cartpole problem from <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-cartepole-problem-competitive-performance-with-particle-swarm-optimization-672f018ede3c" target="_blank">this article</a>. This project involves a neural network trained via reinforcement learning to balance a pole on a cart. Below is a screenshot showcasing my results:</p>

<h4>Pirate Treasure Hunt</h4>
<p>This project was an exciting venture that required developing a Deep Q-Learning algorithm with dual neural networks to find a treasure path. The agent uses a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to approximate Q-Table values and makes educated decisions to navigate the maze.</p>

<p>The maze layout is indicated by the following matrix:</p>

<h3>My Learning as a Computer Scientist</h3>
<p>My problem-solving approach is methodical and logical, leveraging the capabilities of computational tools effectively. I excel at viewing problems from a macro perspective while also diving into the details as needed.</p>

<p>On the ethical front, it's imperative to use computing power responsibly, especially when developing learning algorithms. Such technologies have potential for both positive and negative outcomes, making ethical considerations crucial.</p>
