<h2>Project Showcase: Thorough Analysis of Cartpole and Pirate Treasure Hunt Algorithms</h2>

<h3 id="cartpole">The Cartpole Balancing Dilemma: A Deep Dive</h3>
<p>
  The Cartpole problem is an iconic challenge in the world of reinforcement learning and robotics. It focuses on the difficult task of keeping a pole in a vertical position while it is attached to a moving cart. This presents an intricate dynamic system where small adjustments can make a significant difference. The image below captures a frame from a successful run where the pole is held upright. Achieving this balance is no simple feat; it requires the model to train over several epochs to learn the optimal movements.

<h3 id="pirate-treasure-hunt">Navigating the Labyrinth: An Extensive Overview of the Pirate Treasure Hunt</h3>
<p>
  The Pirate Treasure Hunt is another intricate reinforcement learning project where an agent, depicted as a pirate, has to navigate a maze to reach a treasure chest. This project presents a blend of decision-making and optimization as the agent must make choices at every junction. The images below show the initial state of the maze and the final state with the successfully navigated path. While the maze may look simple, solving it involves complex decision trees and can take numerous iterations.
